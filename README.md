~~When using selection sort the gettimeofday function at line 73 changes the last value of lst to 0~~ Now its just segfaulting at of gettimeofday

Unless there is a print statment with a new line before gettimeofday


Ignore the exceptionally bad code. Its from broken skeleton code my professor gave me
